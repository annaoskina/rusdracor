# RusDraCor

We are building a Russian Drama Corpus with files encoded in [TEI-P5](http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/). Our corpus comprises **68 plays** so far, stemming from [ilibrary](http://ilibrary.ru/), [Wikisource](https://ru.wikisource.org/) and [РВБ](http://rvb.ru/), converted into TEI and corrected by us. There will be more.

If you just want to download the corpus with TEI files, do this:

```
svn export https://github.com/lehkost/RusDraCor/trunk/tei
```

RusDraCor will first be presented on June 29, 2017, at the [Corpora 2017 conference](https://events.spbu.ru/events/anons/corpora-2017/?lang=Eng) in St. Petersburg ([our slides here](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2017-spb/)) and on July 11, 2017, at the ["Digitizing the stage" conference](https://digitizingthestage.wordpress.com/) in Oxford. The social network data we extracted so far can be explored with [our Shinyapp](https://rusdracor.shinyapps.io/showcase/).
